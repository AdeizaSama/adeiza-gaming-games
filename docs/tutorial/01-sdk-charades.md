# 01 — SDK and Charades

**Goal of this chapter:** build the game SDK (random numbers, the machine runner, `defineGame`, the team-turns format and the interaction primitives it needs) and the first game on top of it, Charades, until Charades meets the Definition of Done (standard §13).

**Branch:** `chapter/01-sdk-charades`

## Step 1: Choose how pull requests are merged

**What:** allow two merge methods, squash and rebase, and say in the standard when to use each.

**Why:** chapter 00 showed the problem. GitHub offers three ways to merge a PR:

| Method | What lands on `main` |
|---|---|
| Merge commit | Every commit from the branch, plus an extra "Merge pull request" commit, with a branching history |
| Squash | One commit for the whole PR |
| Rebase | Every commit from the branch, in a straight line, with no extra commit |

Squash suits most PRs: contributors' branches often contain commits like "fix typo" or "wip" that nobody needs on `main`, and one commit per PR is easy to revert. But the tutorial chapters are built one step per commit, with Conventional Commit messages. Squashing a chapter would fold all its steps into a single commit, so the history could no longer be followed step by step.

So:

- **Squash by default.** The PR title becomes the commit message.
- **Rebase when every commit stands on its own** and follows Conventional Commits, as tutorial chapters do.
- **No merge commits.** They add a commit that says nothing and make the history branch.

**Settings (on GitHub):** **Settings → General → Pull Requests**:

- tick **Allow squash merging**, and set its default message to **Default to pull request title**;
- tick **Allow rebase merging**;
- untick **Allow merge commits**.

**Files changed:**

- `docs/game-standard.md` §12: the merge rule.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: PRs are usually squashed, so branch commits don't need to be tidy, but the PR title must follow Conventional Commits.
- `docs/tutorial/01-sdk-charades.md` (new, this file).

**How to verify:** open any PR. The merge button's dropdown offers **Squash and merge** and **Rebase and merge**, and nothing else.
